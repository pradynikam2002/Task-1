# âœ… Contribution Rules

1. **Work in Your Own Branch**
   - Create a branch named after your own name.
   - Push all changes and tasks to your personal branch only.

2. **Daily Pull Request (PR)**
   - At the end of each day, create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch, even if your task is not yet complete.
   - This helps in tracking daily progress and ensures visibility.

3. **Do Not Push to `main`**
   - Never push directly to the main branch.
   - All changes should go through PRs and be reviewed before merging into main.

4. **Need Help?**
   - For any issues or questions, feel free to reach out on Teams.
